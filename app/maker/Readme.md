`maker` is the folder in which the PowerPoint is created and modified with **Python**
and library called [_python-pptx_](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx).


To run this separately from the main program, you have to run `init.py` by typing:  
`$python3 init.py (title) (web)`   
In where:
- *title* is the presentation name.
- *web* is an option to get the readings from www.eucaristiadiaria.cl. Type anything in there and it will be selected.
