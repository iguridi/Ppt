`maker` is the folder in which the PowerPoint is created and modified with `Python`
and the library called [python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx)*.


To run this separately from the main program, you have to run `dev.py` by typing:
`$python3 dev.py <title>`

Where:
- *title* is the presentation name.
