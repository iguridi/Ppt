# README

This project consists of a web page that allows anyone to download an automatically made PowerPoint that is used for displaying the mass readings.

It gets its contents from [http://www.eucaristiadiaria.cl/]

Currently running [here](https://pptmisa.herokuapp.com/)

Tested and deployed with _Python 3.7_

Run locally with `python3 init.py`

## Old readme

`maker` is the folder in which the PowerPoint is created and modified with `Python`
and the library called [python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx)\*.

To run this separately from the main program, you have to run `dev.py` by typing:
`$python3 dev.py <title>`

Where:

- _title_ is the presentation name.
